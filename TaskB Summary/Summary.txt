I have now provided the corrected and adapted code for all the stored procedures, functions, views, and triggers outlined in your "Level B Task" document, tailored for your AdventureWorks database where applicable.

Here's a summary of what has been provided:

Stored Procedures
InsertOrderDetails: Procedure to insert order details, handling optional parameters and SpecialOfferID.
UpdateOrderDetails: Procedure to update existing order details with optional parameters.
GetOrderDetails: Procedure to retrieve order details for a given SalesOrderID.
DeleteOrderDetails: Procedure to delete a specific order detail by SalesOrderID and ProductID.
Functions
FormatDateMMDDYYYY: Function to format a DATETIME value into MM/dd/yyyy string.
FormatDateYYYYMMDD: Function to format a DATETIME value into YYYYMMDD string.
Views
vwCustomerOrders: View providing customer order details, corrected to use Sales.Customer.
vwCustomerOrdersYesterday: View showing customer orders placed yesterday, corrected for syntax.
MyProducts: View listing products with vendor and category, corrected to use Purchasing.ProductVendor for supplier information.
Triggers
trg_InsteadOfDeleteSalesOrderHeader: An INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger on Sales.SalesOrderHeader (adapted from Northwind's Orders) to automatically delete related Sales.SalesOrderDetail records before deleting the header.
trg_CheckStockOnSalesOrderDetailInsert: An INSTEAD OF INSERT trigger on Sales.SalesOrderDetail (adapted from Northwind's Order Details) that conceptually includes stock checking and decrementing logic for AdventureWorks (with notes on complexity regarding Production.ProductInventory and LocationID).
For each, I've also provided instructions on how to create/re-create them in SSMS, how to execute/query them, and how to test their functionality.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific examples or error messages for these objects, feel free to ask!
